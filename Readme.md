            Integrated Water Replenishment and Management System
            

**Problem Statement:**

- Water shortage is one of the biggest problems plaguing various pockets of the world today. 

- By the time the officials are notified of the scarcity of water in their jurisdiction, there is a high chance that it turns into a crisis.

- This results in drastic and unplanned replenishment actions which would result in a higher cost for the government.



**Approach**

- We created a centralized framework which caters to the various water replenishment strategies and itâ€™s respective costs based on the following parameters:

    -   Soil Type of the regions
    -   Artificial Source of Water
    -   Interstate Transportation of Water

-   The system follows a governance hierarchy in dealing with work requests.


**External Libraries:**

- Apache POI for reading and writing from csv
- DB4O for database
